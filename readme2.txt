Title : CARBOMETER

Description : Carbometer is a desktop application that calculates the total damage that users do to nature and encourages them to donate as much as the damage they have caused to nature. Carbometer makes the users' damage level more understandable, with a special unit called Carbopoint. With its intuitive interface thanks to Carbobar, Carbometer provides users with a simple to use yet effective experience.

Current Status: Unfinished

What Has Been Done: 
All the graphical user interface components completed whether the core classes responsible to manipulate them completed or not. A normal user can create a new report,
check the old reports, can add friends, see and compare their Carbopoints and make donations linked non-governmental environmental organizations. Carbobars are working
efficiently. Pages are connected with Java Swing Library's CardLayout ability. Database is working and the reports which were created by the user are stored in the
local database. Creating a new user, and forgotten password situation, e-mail verification code are sent.

What Works:
All the listed things in the - What has been done - part are working efficiently and without bugs, errors. 

What Doesn't:
Although the GUI part of the project is completed, Super-user, Add Challenge and Recommendations have not been implemented in the core of the Carbometer. 

What Remains To Be Done:
Super-user, Add Challenge and Recommendations core classes.

Files that I primarily worked on: View (Graphical User Interface) classes and Controller of the application. I used NetBeans v8.2, Eclipse 2019, and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version. Java Swing Library used to draw GUI components. For background, JLabel and to get user input, JTextField. For the controller, JButtons and JLabels used. to communicate with the user to provide easy to use UI, JOptionPane pop-ups were added.

Files that I primarily worked on: user core classes and mail package. I worked with alper we watched videos to do mail package. We learned how to use JavaMailUtil library and
did the user classes having user as abstract class and super user and normal user as classes from user abstract class.

Files that I primarily worked on: Model classes(Category, Challenge, Food, Home, Others, Report, Transportation), user package (Abstract User class, and the NormalUser and SuperUser classes that extends User class), and
mail package (JavaMail, and JavaMailUtil classes). I used Java SDK15 and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version to commit and fetch the files easily. Lastly, I used activation.jar & javax.mail.jar to send email to the user as our teacher requested during UI Presentation.

I worked on all the Graphical User Interface classes and some of their implementation, I worked on all the raports and presentations. Since I generally work with Onur, 
just like him, I used NetBeans v8.2, Eclipse 2019, and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version. We used Java Swing Library for creating GUI and in the backgrond JLabel and to
get user input, JTextField. For the controller, JButtons and JLabels used. To communicate with the user to provide easy to use UI, JOptionPane pop-ups were added. We 
also connect panels with CardLayout and in the panels we used NullLayout for creating a application as closest to out wireframes.
