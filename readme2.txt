Files that I primarily worked on: View (Graphical User Interface) classes and Controller of the application. I used NetBeans v8.2, Eclipse 2019, and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version. Java Swing Library used to draw GUI components. For background, JLabel and to get user input, JTextField. For the controller, JButtons and JLabels used. to communicate with the user to provide easy to use UI, JOptionPane pop-ups were added.

Files that I primarily worked on: user core classes and mail package. I worked with alper we watched videos to do mail package. We learned how to use JavaMailUtil library and
did the user classes having user as abstract class and super user and normal user as classes from user abstract class.

Files that I primarily worked on: Model classes(Category, Challenge, Food, Home, Others, Report, Transportation),  others package, user package (Abstract User class, and the NormalUser and SuperUser classes that extends User class),
mail package (JavaMail, and JavaMailUtil classes). I used Java SDK15 and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version to commit and fetch the files easily. Lastly, I used activation.jar & javax.mail.jar to send email to the user as our teacher requested during UI Presentation.

I worked on all the Graphical User Interface classes and some of their implementation, I worked on all the raports and presentations. Since I generally work with Onur, just like him, I used NetBeans v8.2, Eclipse 2019, and IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3 x64 version. We used Java Swing Library for creating GUI and in the backgrond JLabel and to get user input, JTextField. For the controller, JButtons and JLabels used. To communicate with the user to provide easy to use UI, JOptionPane pop-ups were added. We also connect panels with CardLayout and in the panels we used NullLayout for creating a application as closest to out wireframes.
