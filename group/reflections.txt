We have made an effective and easy-to-use application where people can easily calculate
their level of damage to nature and fulfill their responsibilities by donating as much
as their damage level. In GUI, database and core classes, so at every point of our 
application, we have took what we learned in the course and added it to it. We learned 
new and necessary things such as how to do research, how to report a project, how to work 
as a group. In addition, I have developed in areas that I think will be very useful in
professional life, such as dividing work as a team and working efficiently and establishing
correct communication between sub-teams. I think I have had an efficient learning process
and gained quite important experiences in GUI, project  development and team  communication 
since I have never had experience in such areas before. What I do not like about the project
is, even though we spend hours on it, design we created does not  look modern at all. I am
aware that this is my first project/design experience, but I do not like  that my first 
product looks like a windows 7 application designed in the 2010 and I am one of the responsible
ones for this situation. The point that I had the most difficulty while doing the project 
was the learning process of the implementation. Sometimes I stared at the screen inefficiently
for hours and found out that the solution was very easy. Jumping directly into topics like
CardLayout instead of  learning in advance drove me into an unpredictable chaos. If I have 
to start the application from the beginning, I would make the task distribution more realistic
(in terms of database and reports) and avoid unnecessary fatigue. I would consider using FX
instead of Swing, so I would make a design that would look much more modern. In the first half
of the semester, although I did not do much work except report, mockup and wireframe design, 
I spent the last seven weeks very intensely and with my sub-teammate Onur, I completed all the
GUI parts and switch to the missing parts of the project. I am very proud of what we have done 
and implemented. Even though there are many applications that calculate someone's carbon footprint,
we have calculated the total damage of users and I think this idea is quite original when other
features are taken into account. We did not give people a random donation value or encourage
them to donate the amount of money they wanted. We have created a mechanism for them to calculate
their responsibility towards nature on their behalf, and this is why I am very proud. The 
creation of our calculation algorithms, the success and accuracy of our reports, the source 
of every data we use, and the reliability of these sources can be the subject we are best at.
Finally, I would like to thank my sub-team friend Onur Ertunç, who was working with me until dawns
dozens of times over zoom. (12.28.2020)
