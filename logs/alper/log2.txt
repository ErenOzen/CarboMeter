This week I've done the followings to contribute the app:

We revised the core classes to connect them to the database.
I created a mail package and its classes which is working well.(used activation.jar and javax.mail.jar)
I tried to find new questions for the Carbometer project and determine it's constants properly.
We added all the classes JavaDoc comment and make the codes more understandable.
